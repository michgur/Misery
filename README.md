### Misery is a lightweight game engine that provides a simple & intuitive interface to develop 3D mobile games in the Kotlin programming language for Android. The inner workings of the engine are developed in C++ via the Android NDK in order to make Misery games as fast & memory efficient as possible!
### Features:
- An ECS(Entity component system) framework that's simple & scalable
- Load and render `.obj` and `.fbx` 3D objects
